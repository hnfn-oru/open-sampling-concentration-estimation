In the folder "Raw Sensor Data" you will find the raw data for training, testing and validation in .csv format.
In each file the time, place, wind speed and sensor response of the MICS5524 (MOX) and PID sensors is given.
 
There are four sensors stuck on top of each other at different heights, these are called the sensor layers (0 to 3).
The sensor layer that takes the measurements is given in the file name. For the MOX sensors, each sensor needs to be calibrated seperately.
Therefore the "clean air" data is given, in which the sensor response in clean air is recorded.

Ground truth source position:
The ground truth position for the source in the training data set is: x=0.675, y=0.336, z=0.179. 


The /train folder includes the raw data sorted into:
	- /experiment: raw data of the experiments and each sensor layer
	- /upstream: raw data of the upstream sensors in the foreland region, this is helpful to measure the increasing
	  background concentration of the emitted gas. The two sensors show different background concentration at times.
	- /test: data taken from random, not sequential points in space for testing. The selected points are weighted, so that 70 % of the points 
	  are in the plume. Each file contains the data point from one layer and the information of the 150 (15 seconds) prevoius time steps, 
	  and 150 (15 seconds) following time steps. It contains a 100 batches with each 500 selected points.
	- /clean: measurements taken in clean air (no gas was being released) to calibrate the MOX sensors. The sensors where not moving during the measurements.
	  It contains data taken for 17 minutes.

The /validation folder contains the raw data sorted into:
	- /upstream: raw data of the upstream sensors in the foreland region, this is helful to measure the increasing
	  background concentration of the emitted gas. The two sensors show different background concentration at times.
	- /test: data taken from random, not sequential points in space for testing. The selected points are weighted, so that 70 % of the points 
	  are in the plume. Each file contains the data point from one layer and the information of the 150 (15 seconds) previous time steps, 
	  and 150 (15 seconds) following time steps. It contains a 100 batches with each 500 selected points.
	- /clean: measurements taken in clean air (no gas was being released) to calibrate the MOX sensors. The sensors where not moving during the measurements.
	  It contains data taken for 17 minutes.

Definition of the text boxes in the csv files:
	- time: moment of time at which the measurement was taken in the format YYYY-MM-DD XX:XX:XX.XXXXXX. The step size is about 0.1 seconds.
	- x, y, z: location at which the measurement was taken. Z-position has a 2.5 cm offset to the floor, which is included in z.
	  When the sensors are moving to the next cell, no x,y,z coordinates are given.
	- MiCS5524: sensor response in voltage. 
	- PID-sensor: sensor response in voltage. 
	- wind-u, wind-v, wind-w: wind speed at the measurement point in m/s. The measurements taken while the sensors are moving should be taken with caution.  
	- x_reported, y_reported, z_reported: location at which the measurement was taken. Z-reported does not include the 2.5 cm offset.

Data Visualization:
	the python file "visualize_train_experiment.py" takes the /train/experiment and plots the data of one sensor-type in one layer
	in a 3D image with slider. The slider can be moved in x-direction to have a view of each measurement point in the room.
 	To visualize the /train/test use "visualize_test.py". The path of a test file can be inserted and it will plot the voltage as a functino of time.
